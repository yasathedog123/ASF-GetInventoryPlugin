ASF license is very permissive and you're allowed to do much more than in standard GPL license, including using ASF in commercial projects without a requirement of making code open-source. In short, as stated by tl;dr Legal:

By stating that ASF is licensed under **[Apache License 2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/main/LICENSE.txt)**, we refer to the main project **only**, including its source code, without making any statements about other projects that ASF makes use of (especially libraries, tools, frameworks and frontends, such as **[ASF-ui](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ASF-ui)**), which are typically licensed under different terms.
