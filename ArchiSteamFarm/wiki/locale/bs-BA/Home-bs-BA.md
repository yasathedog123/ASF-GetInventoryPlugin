# Početna

Dobrodošli u ASF Wiki. Wiki je online pomoćnik koji pokriva razne teme kao što su najčešće postavljena pitanja, mogući problemi, način korišćenja, podešavanje, i mnogo ostalog. Ovo je ono što trebate pratiti ako želite da naučite kako ASF radi, posebno kako da ga instalirate, podesite i koristite.

Možete promijeniti jezik wiki-a ako promijenite `-locale` dio bilo koje posjećene stranice. Npr. umjesto da posjetite **[Home](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Home)** stranicu, možete dodati **[Home-ru-RU](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Home-ru-RU)** da bi posjetili početnu stranicu na ruskom(ako je prevedena). Jezici koji su prevedeni više od 90% biće dodati u listi pored (desno) za lakši pristup.

All wiki pages always apply to **[latest ASF release](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases)** only, unless stated otherwise (like "V2"). If you'd like to see a wiki page in given fixed point of time (for example for a bit older ASF release), use **[revisions](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/_history)** that are available on top of each page and pick a date that is appropriate for the date of your ASF release. We keep all pages available for current, as well as previous major ASF version.

If you're a new user, we recommend starting with **[setting up](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Setting-up)** guide. You can find all other relevant wiki pages on our sidebar, on the right side of the screen. We suggest to start from the top, although feel free to read anything that seems remotely interesting to you, there are no limits on ASF knowledge.

If you need further help, please check out our **[support channels](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/blob/main/.github/SUPPORT.md)**, which you can use for all the questions and technical difficulties.

GitHub **[issues](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/issues)** page is being used for ASF development, especially in regards to bugs and enhancements. We have a very strict policy regarding that, as GitHub is **not** a general support channel, it's dedicated exclusively to ASF development and we're not answering common ASF matters there, as we have appropriate **[support channels](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/blob/main/.github/SUPPORT.md)** for that. If you're not sure whether your matter relates to ASF development or not, we recommend to use a support channel instead. Invalid GitHub issues will be closed immediately and won't be answered.
