## 常規

### What is ASF?
### Why does the program claim that there is nothing to farm on my account?
### Why ASF doesn't detect all of my games?
### Why is my account limited?

在嘗試了解 ASF 之前，您應該先了解什麼是交換卡片以及如何得到它們，這在官方**[常見問題](https://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/faq)**中有很好的說明。

簡而言之，Steam 卡牌是您在擁有特定遊戲時有資格獲得的收藏物品，可用於製作徽章、在 Steam 市集上銷售或您選擇的任何其他目的。

Core points are stated once again here, because people in general don't want to agree with them and prefer to pretend that those do not exist:

- **You need to own the game on your Steam account in order to be eligible for any card drops from it. 親友同享的遊戲不算數。**
- **You can't farm the game infinitely, every game has fixed number of card drops. Once you drop all of them (around a half of the full set), the game is not a candidate for farming anymore. It doesn't matter whether you've sold, traded, crafted or forgot what happened to those cards you've obtained, once you run out of card drops, the game is finished.**
- **You can't drop cards from F2P games without spending any money in them. This means permanently F2P games like Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2. Owning F2P games does not grant you card drops.**
- **You can't drop cards on [limited accounts](https://help.steampowered.com/faqs/view/71D3-35C2-AD96-AA3A), regardless of owned games. 這在過去是有可能的，但現在已經不是這樣了。**
- **Paid games that you've obtained for free during a promotion can't be farmed for card drops, regardless of what is displayed on the store page. 這在過去是有可能的，但現在已經不是這樣了。**

So as you can see, Steam cards are awarded to you for playing a game that you bought, or F2P game that you've put money into. If you play such game long enough, all cards for that game will eventually drop to your inventory, making it possible for you to complete a badge (after obtaining the remaining half of the set), sell them, or do whatever else you want.

Now that we've explained the basics of Steam, we can explain ASF. The program itself is quite complex to understand fully, so instead of digging into all the technical details, we'll offer a very simplified explanation below.

ASF 使用您提供的憑據，通過內置自訂 Steam 用戶端實現登錄到您的Steam帳戶。 After successfully logging in, it parses your **[badges](https://steamcommunity.com/my/badges)** in order to find games that are available for farming (`X` card drops remaining). 在分析了所有徽章頁面並構建了可用遊戲的最終清單後，ASF 選擇了最有效的掛卡算法並啟動進程。 The process depends upon chosen **[cards farming algorithm](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Performance)** but usually it consists of playing eligible game and periodically (plus on each item drop) checking if game is fully farmed already - if yes, ASF can proceed with the next title, using the same procedure, until all games are fully farmed.

請記住，上面的解釋是簡化的，並不阐述 ASF 提供的諸多額外功能和特性。 如果你想了解ASF的所有細節，請訪問我們的 **[wiki](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki)** 的其餘部分。 我盡可能簡明地講解，以讓每個人都能理解它，但並未帶來技術細節——在此鼓勵高級用戶更深入地挖掘。

現在作為一個程式，ASF提供了一些魔法。 第一, 它不需要下載任何你的遊戲檔案，它可以馬上玩遊戲。 其次, 它完全獨立于您的Steam用戶端——您根本不需要運行Steam用戶端, 甚至根本不需要安裝Steam用戶端。 第三，它是自動化的解決方案。這意味著 ASF 會在後台自動做所有的事情，而不需要您告訴它該怎麼做，這減少了您的麻煩並节省您的時間。 最後，它不需要通過過程模擬來欺騙Steam網絡（例如Idle Master正在使用的邏輯），因為它可以直接與Steam網絡通信。 它也是超快和輕量級的，是一個驚人的解決方案，讓每個人輕鬆地獲得卡片——您可以讓它運行在後台，而去做其他的事情，甚至在離線模式下玩。

All of the above is nice, but ASF also has some technical limitations that are enforced by Steam - we can't farm games that you don't own, we can't farm games forever in order to get extra drops past the enforced limit, and we can't farm games while you're playing. All of that should be "logical", considering the way how ASF works, but it's nice to note that ASF doesn't have super-powers and won't do something that is physically impossible, so keep that in mind - it's basically the same as if you told someone to log in on your account from another PC and farm those games for you.

所以總結起來，ASF是一個可以讓你獲得那些可掉落卡片的程式, 沒有太多麻煩。 它還提供了其他幾個功能, 但讓我們暫時專注於此功能。

---

### 我必須提供我的帳戶憑據嗎？

**是的**。 ASF要求您的帳戶憑據的方式與官方Steam用戶端一致，因為它使用與Steam網絡交互相同的方法。 但是，這並不意味著您必須將您的帳戶憑據放在ASF配置中，您可以在` SteamLogin `和/或` SteamPassword `為` null ` 時繼續使用 ASF，並在必要時輸入每個 ASF 運行需要的數據（以及其他登錄憑據，請參閱配置）。 這樣，您的詳細資訊不會保存在任何地方，但如果沒有您的幫助，ASF 無法自行啟動。 ASF 還提供了其他幾種方法來提高您的 **[安全性](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Security)**，因此，如果您是高級用戶，請隨時閱讀 wiki 的這一部分。 如果您不是, 並且不想將您的帳戶憑據放在ASF配置中, 則無需這樣做, 而是在ASF要求時根據需要輸入它們。

請記住, ASF工具是供您個人使用的, 您的憑據永遠不會離開您的電腦。 You're also not sharing them with anybody, which fulfills **[Steam ToS](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement)** - a very important thing that many people forget about. 您的詳細資訊將不會被發送到我們的伺服器或協力項目, 而將直接發送到Valve運營的 Steam 伺服器。 無論您是否將您的憑據放入配置中，我們都無從知道您的憑據，更無法為您恢復，。

---

### 我需要等待多久才會獲得掉落的卡片？

講真，**這取決於它需要多久。** 每款遊戲的掛卡難度由開發商/出版商設定, 掉卡速度完全取決於他們。 大多數遊戲是每 3 0分鐘就會掉落1張卡片, 但也有遊戲需要在遊玩幾個小時後才會有卡片掉落。 In addition to that, your account could be restricted from receiving card drops from games you didn't play for enough time yet, as stated in **[performance](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Performance)** section. 不要試圖猜測ASF可能的掛卡時間，這不是由您決定的，甚至也不是ASF可以決定的。 沒有什麼辦法可以讓它更快，並且沒有與未及時獲得掉落卡片相關的“錯誤”——您無法控制卡片掉落過程，ASF亦然。 在最好的情況下, 您平均每30分鐘可獲得1張掉落的卡片。 在最壞的情況下, 啟動ASF 4小時後您也有可能顆粒無收。 這兩種情況都是正常的, 並會在我們的 **[performance](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Performance)** 部分仲介紹。

---

### 掛卡花的時間太長, 我能加快它的速度嗎？

唯一嚴重影響掛卡速度的是您為您的機械人實例選擇的**[掛卡算法 ](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Performance)**。 其他一切行為僅會帶來微不足道的影響, 不會使掛卡更快, 而一些行動, 如多次啟動 ASF 過程, 甚至會 **使它更糟糕**。 如果您真的在掛卡過程中分秒必爭，那麼ASF允許您微調一些核心掛卡變數，例如` FarmingDelay `——所有這些都在** <a href=“https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration”>配置</a> **中解釋了。 然而，正如我所說，效果可以忽略不計，為給定的帳戶選擇合適的掛卡算法是一個關鍵的選擇，可以嚴重影響掛卡的速度，其他一切都是錦上添花。 與其擔心掛卡速度，不如放手讓 ASF 自主運行──我可以向你保證，它是以我能想出的最有效的方式來工作的。 認真你就輸了。

---

### 但 ASF 說掛卡將需要大約 X 小時！

ASF根據您可獲得的掉落卡牌數和您選擇的算法給出粗略的近似值——這與您在掛卡上花費的實際時間相差無幾，但通常比這更長，因為ASF僅假設最佳情況，並且忽略所有Steam網絡怪癖，互聯網斷開，Steam服務器過載等異常情況。 它應該只被視為一個常規指標，通常您可以預估ASF在最好情況下的掛卡時間，因為實際時間會有所不同，甚至在某些情況下會是顯著的。 如上所述，不要試圖猜測給定的遊戲掛卡需要多久，這不是您可以決定的，也不是 ASF 可以決定的。

---

### ASF 可以在我的 Android/智慧手機上工作嗎？

ASF is a C# program that requires working implementation of .NET. Android became a valid platform starting with .NET 6.0, however, there is currently a major blocker in making ASF happen on Android due to **[lack of ASP.NET runtime available on it](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/35077)**. Even though there isn't a native option available, there are proper and working builds for GNU/Linux on ARM architecture, so it's totally possible to use something like **[Linux Deploy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.meefik.linuxdeploy)** for installing Linux, then using ASF in such Linux chroot as usual.

When/If all ASF requirements are satisfied, we'll consider releasing an official Android build.

---

### Can ASF farm items from Steam games, such as CS:GO or Unturned?

**No**, this is against **[Steam ToS](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement)** and Valve clearly stated that with last wave of community bans for farming TF2 items. ASF 是一個 Steam 掛卡項目，而不是掛機項目——它沒沒有任何掛機的能力，並且未來也不會添加此類功能，因為這違反了 Steam 使用條款。 Please do not ask about this - the best you can get is a report from some salty user and you having problems. The same goes for all other types of farming, such as farming drops from CS:GO broadcasts. ASF 專注于Steam交易卡片。

---

### Can I choose which games should be farmed?

**當然**，這有幾種不同的方式。 If you want to alter the default order of farming queue, then that's what `FarmingOrders` **[bot configuration property](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#bot-config)** can be used for. If you want to manually blacklist given games from being farmed automatically, you can use idle blacklist which is available with `fb` **[command](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**. If you'd like to farm everything but give some apps priority over everything else, that is what idle priority queue available with `fq` **[command](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)** can be used for. And finally, if you want to farm specific games of your choice only, then you can use `FarmPriorityQueueOnly` **[bot configuration property](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#bot-config)** in order to achieve this, together with adding your selected apps to idle priority queue.

In addition to managing automatic cards farming module which was described above, you can also switch ASF to manual farming mode with `play` **[command](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**, or use some other misc external settings such as `GamesPlayedWhileIdle` **[bot configuration property](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#bot-config)**.

---

### I'm not interested in card drops, I'd like to farm hours played instead, is that possible?

Yes, ASF allows you to do that through at least several ways.

The best way to achieve that is to make use of **[`GamesPlayedWhileIdle`](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#gamesplayedwhileidle)** configuration property, which will play your chosen appIDs when ASF has no cards to farm. If you'd like to play your games all the time, even if you do have card drops from other games, then you can combine it with **[`FarmPriorityQueueOnly`](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#farmpriorityqueueonly)**, so ASF will farm only those games for card drops that you explicitly set, or **[`Paused`](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#paused)**, which will cause cards farming module to be paused until you unpause it yourself.

Alternatively, you can make use of the **[`play`](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands#commands-1)** command, which will cause ASF to play your selected games. However, keep in mind that `play` should be used only for games you want to play temporarily, as it's not a persistent state, causing ASF to revert back to default state e.g. upon disconnection from Steam network. Therefore, we recommend you to use `GamesPlayedWhileIdle`, unless you indeed want to start your selected games just for a short time period, and then revert back to general flow.

---

### I'm Linux / macOS user, will ASF farm games that are not available for my OS? Will ASF farm 64-bit games when I'm running it on 32-bit OS?

是的，ASF甚至不打算下載實際的遊戲文件，因此無論平台或技術要求如何，它都可以與您的Steam帳戶綁定的所有許可證一起使用。 It should also work for games tied to specific region (region-locked games) even when you're not in the matching region, although we don't guarantee that (it worked last time we tried).

---

## 與類似的工具比較

---

### ASF與Idle Master相似嗎？

The only similarity is the general purpose of both programs, which is farming Steam games in order to receive card drops. Everything else, including the actual farming method, program structure, functionality, compatibility, used algorithms, especially the source code itself, is entirely different and those two programs have nothing common with each other, even the core foundation - IM is running on .NET Framework, ASF on .NET (Core). 創建ASF是為了解決通過簡單的代碼編輯無法解決的IM問題——這就是為什麼ASF未參考IM的任何想法甚至是一行代碼，而是獨闢蹊徑，因為那些代碼和想法先天不足。 IM 和 ASF 正如同 Windows 和 Linux ——兩者都是作業系統，都可以安裝在你的電腦上，但除了服務于類似的目的之外，它們幾乎沒有共同之處。

這也是您不應根據IM預期將ASF與IM進行比較的原因。 您應該將 ASF 和 IM 視為具有其專用功能集的完全獨立的程式。 其中一些功能確實重疊，您可以在兩者之間找到某些相似的特定功能，但很不會太多，因為ASF正在以與IM完全不同的方法來實現其目的。

---

### 如果我目前使用的是IM，它對我來說很好，那麼換成ASF值得嗎？

**是的**。 ASF is much more reliable and includes many built-in functions that are **crucial** regardless of the way how you farm, that IM simply doesn't offer.

ASF has proper logic for **unreleased games** - IM will attempt to farm games that have cards added already, even if they weren't released yet. Of course, it's not possible to farm those games until release date, so your farming process will be stuck. 這將要求您將其添加到黑名單、等待發佈或手動跳過。 Neither of those solutions is good, and all of them require your attention - ASF automatically skips farming of unreleased games (temporarily), and returns back to them later when they are, completely avoiding the problem and dealing with it efficiently.

ASF also has proper logic of **series** videos. There are many videos on Steam that have cards, yet are announced with wrong `appID` on the badges page, such as **[Double Fine Adventure](https://store.steampowered.com/app/402590)** - IM will falsely farm wrong `appID`, which will yield no drops and process being stuck. 同樣，您需要將其列入黑名單或手動跳過掛卡進程，這兩者都值得您的注意。 ASF automatically discovers proper `appID` for farming which does result in card drops.

In addition to that, ASF is **much more stable and reliable** when it comes to network problems and Steam quirks - it works most of the time and doesn't require your attention at all once configured, while IM often breaks for many people, requires extra fixes or simply doesn't work regardless. 它也完全依賴於您的Steam客戶端，這意味著當您的Steam客戶端遇到任何嚴重問題時它無法運行。 只要可以連接到Steam網絡，ASF就會正常工作，這不需要運行甚至安裝Steam客戶端。

Those are 3 **very important** points why you should consider using ASF, as they directly affect everybody farming Steam cards and there is no way to say "this doesn't consider me", since Steam maintenances and quirks are happening to everybody. There are dozen of extra less and more important reasons which you may learn about in the rest of the FAQ. 簡而言之，**是的**，即使您不需要與IM相比可用的額外ASF功能，也應使用ASF。

In addition to that, IM is officially discontinued and can break completely in the future, without anybody bothering to fix it, considering existence of much more powerful solutions (not only ASF). IM已經不適用於很多人，而且這個數字只多不少。 您應該首先避免使用過時的軟件，不僅僅是IM，而是所有其他已棄用的程序。 No active maintainer means that nobody cares whether it works or not and **nobody is responsible for its functionality**, which is a crucial matter in terms of security. It's enough that there will be a critical bug causing actual problems to Steam infrastructure - with nobody fixing it, Steam can issue another ban wave in which you'll get hit without even being aware of this being an issue, as already happened to people using, guess what, obsolete version of ASF.

### ASF 提供了哪些 Idle Master 沒有的有趣功能？

這取決於您認為何謂“有趣”。 If you plan to farm more accounts than one then the answer is already obvious since ASF allows you to farm all of them with one superior solution, saving resources, hassle, and compatibility issues. However, if you're asking that question then most likely you don't have this particular need, so let's evaluate other benefits that apply to one single account used in ASF.

First and foremost, you have some built-in features mentioned **[above](#is-it-worth-it-to-use-asf-if-im-currently-using-idle-master-and-it-works-fine-for-me)** that are core for farming regardless of your end-goal, and very often that alone is already enough to consider using ASF. 但是您已經知道了，所以讓我們轉到一些更有趣的功能：

- **You can farm offline** (`OnlineStatus` in `Offline` setting). Farming offline makes it possible for you to skip your Steam in-game status entirely, which allows you to farm with ASF while showing "Online" on Steam at the same time, without your friends even noticing that ASF is playing a game on your behalf. 這是優越的功能，因為它允許您保持Steam用戶端在線，而不以持續的上線提醒惹惱您的朋友，或誤導他們認為您在玩遊戲，而現實中您並不是如此。 如果您尊重自己的朋友，僅憑這一點就值得使用ASF，但這只是一個開始。 It's also nice to note that this feature has nothing to do with Steam privacy settings - if you launch the game yourself, then you'll properly show as in-game to your friends, making only ASF part invisible and not affecting your account at all.

- **You can skip refundable games** (`SkipRefundableGames` feature). ASF has proper built-in logic for refundable games and you can configure ASF to not farm refundable games automatically. This allows you to evaluate yourself if your newly-bought game from Steam store was worth your money, without ASF trying to drop cards from it as soon as possible. 如果您玩遊戲2個小時以上，或者遊戲購買以來已經過去2週，那麼ASF將對該遊戲進行掛卡，因為它不再可退款。 Until then you have full control whether you enjoy it or not and you can easily refund it if needed, without having to manually blacklist that game or not use ASF for entire duration.

- **您可以自動將新物品消息標記為已讀**（在` BotBehaviour `中啓用` DismissInventoryNotifications `功能）。 Farming with ASF will result in your account receiving new card drops. You already know that this is going to happen, so let ASF clear that useless notification for you, ensuring that only important things will raise your attention. 當然，只有你想。

- **您可以自動從Steam活動中**獲取卡片（` AutoSteamSaleEvent `功能）。 ASF allows you to automate going through discovery queue during Steam sale, of course only if you'd like to make use of that. 這可以在Steam特賣期間為您節省大量的時間，並確保您再也不會錯過每日可獲得的卡片。

- **You can customize preferred farming order with more available options** (`FarmingOrders` feature). Perhaps you want to farm your newly bought games first? 還是最舊的？ 根據可掉落的卡片數？ 您已經獲得的徽章級別？ 遊戲時間？ 字母順序？ 按照AppIDs? 或者完全隨機？ 這都完全取決於你。

- ** ASF可以幫助您集齊卡片**（` TradingPreferences `與` SteamTradeMatcher `功能）。 With a bit more advanced tinkering, you can convert your ASF into fully-featured user-bot that will automatically accept **[STM](https://www.steamtradematcher.com)** offers, helping you each day to match your sets without any user interaction. ASF甚至包括其獨有的ASF 2FA模組，允許您導入Steam移動驗證器，並讓您完全自動化整個交易過程。 或者，也許您想要手動處理ASF為您準備好的交易？ 再次強調，完全由你來決定。

- **ASF可以在后台為您兌換產品序號**（**[后台序號激活器](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Background-games-redeemer)**功能）。 也許您有來自各種遊戲包的上百個密鑰，但您懶得自己打開一堆窗口並一遍又一遍地同意Steam條款和條件以兌換。 為什麼不將您的密鑰清單複製粘貼到ASF中並讓它自行完成工作呢？ ASF將自動在後台兌換所有這些密鑰，為您提供準確的輸出，讓您知道每次兌換嘗試的結果。 Moreover, if you have hundreds of keys, you're guaranteed to get rate-limited by Steam sooner or later, and ASF also knows about that, it'll patiently wait for the rate-limit to go away, and resume where it left.

We could now go on and on with entire **[ASF wiki](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Home)**, pointing out every single feature of the program, but we have to draw a line somewhere. This is it, this is a list of features that you can enjoy as ASF user, where just one of those could easily be considered a major reason to never look back, and we actually listed **a lot** of them, with even more you can learn about on the rest of our wiki. Ah yes, and we didn't even go into detail with things like ASF's API allowing you to script your own commands, or awesome bots management, since we wanted to keep it simple.

### ASF 的掛卡速度快於 Idle Master 嗎？

**是的**，雖然解釋起來相當複雜。

On each new process spawned and terminated on your system, steam client automatically sends a request containing all of your games that you're currently playing - this way steam network can calculate hours and make cards drop. However, steam network counts your time played in 1-second intervals, and sending new request resets the current status. In other words, if you did spawn/kill new process every 0.5 second, you'd never drop any card because every 0.5 second steam client would send a new request and steam network would never count even 1 second of play time. Moreover, because of how operating system works, it's actually quite common to see new processes being spawned/terminated without you even doing anything, so even if you're doing nothing on your PC - there are many processes still working in the background, spawning/terminating other processes all the time. Idle master is based on steam client, so this mechanism affects you if you're using it.

ASF is not based on steam client, it has its own steam client implementation. Thanks to that, what ASF is doing, is not spawning any process, but actually sending one, real request to steam network that we started playing a game. This is the same request that would be sent by steam client, but because we have actual control over the ASF steam client, we don't need to spawn new processes, and we're not mimicking steam client regarding send request on every process change, so the mechanism explained above doesn't affect us. Thanks to that, we never interrupt that 1 second interval on steam web side, and that enhances our farming speed.

---

### 但這種差異真的很明顯嗎？

不。 正常Steam客戶端和IM發生的中斷對掛卡的影響可以忽略不計，因此沒有任何明顯的差異可以使ASF更優越。

However, there **is** a difference, and you can clearly notice that, as depending on how busy your OS is, cards **will** drop faster, from a few seconds to even a few minutes, if you're extremely unlucky. Although I wouldn't consider using ASF only because it drops cards faster, as both ASF and Idle Master are affected by how steam web works, ASF just interacts with steam web more effectively, while Idle Master can't control what steam client is actually doing (so it's not Idle Master's fault, but steam client's itself).

---

### Can ASF farm multiple games at once?

**是的**，雖然ASF根據所選的** [掛卡算法，即可知道何時使用該功能更好](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Performance) **。 Card drops rate when farming multiple games is close to zero, this is why ASF is using multiple games farming exclusively for hours in order to overcome `HoursUntilCardDrops` faster, for up to `32` games at once. This is also why you should focus on configuration part of the ASF, and let algorithms decide what is the best way to achieve the goal - what you think is right, is not necessarily right in reality, farming multiple games at once will not provide you with any card drops.

---

### Can ASF skip through games fast?

**No**, ASF doesn't support, neither encourages usage of **[Steam glitches](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Performance#steam-glitches)**.

---

### Can ASF automatically play each game for X hours before cards are added?

**No**, the whole point of Steam cards system change was to fight with false statistics and ghost players. ASF won't contribute towards that more than necessary, adding such feature is not planned and won't happen. If your game receives card drops in usual way, ASF will farm them as soon as possible.

---

### 我能在 ASF 掛卡時玩遊戲嗎？

**不行**。 ASF unlike IM has independent Steam client included, and Steam network allows only **one Steam client at a time** to play a game. You can however disconnect ASF any time you like by starting a game (and clicking "OK" when asked if Steam network should disconnect other client) - ASF will then patiently wait till you're done playing, and resume the process afterwards. Alternatively, you can still play in offline mode anytime you like, if that is satisfying for you.

Keep in mind that cards drop rate when playing multiple games is close to 0 anyway, therefore there are no direct benefits from being able to do that with IM, while there are strong benefits of no interfering with other games launched with ASF, which is crucial e.g. VAC-wise.

---

## 安全/隱私/VAC/封鎖/條款

---

### 我會因為使用它被 VAC 封鎖嗎？

No, it's not possible because ASF (unlike Idle Master or SAM) does not interfere in any way with steam client nor its processes. It's physically impossible to get VAC ban for using ASF, even during playing on secured servers while ASF is running - this is because **ASF doesn't even require Steam Client being installed at all** in order to work properly. ASF是目前唯一可以保證不被VAC的掛卡程式。

---

### Can using ASF prevent me from playing on VAC-secured servers, as stated **[here](https://help.steampowered.com/faqs/view/22C0-03D0-AE4B-04E8)**?

運行ASF並不要求同時運行Steam客戶端，甚至根本需要不安裝Steam。 According to this concept, it should **not** cause any VAC-related issues, because ASF guarantees lack of interfering with Steam client and all its processes - this is the main point when talking about VAC-free guarantee that ASF offers.

根據用戶和我所知，現在就是這種情況，因為在使用ASF時沒有人報告上述鏈接中所述的任何問題。 我們也無法使用ASF重現上述問題，但卻可以使用Idle Master清楚地再現它。

However, keep in mind that Valve could still add ASF to the blacklist at some point, but it's a complete nonsense as even if they do that, you could still play VAC-secured games from your PC, and use ASF at the same time e.g. on your server, so I'm pretty sure that they know very well that ASF should not be a suspect VAC-wise, and they won't make our lifes harder by blacklisting ASF for no reason. Still, in the worst case you'll be unable to play, like stated above, because VAC-free guarantee of ASF is still here regardless if Steam blacklists ASF binary, or not (and you can still launch ASF on any other machine without Steam client being installed at all). 現在沒有必要做任何這樣的事情，讓我們希望它保持這樣。

---

### 它安全嗎？

如果您詢問ASF作為軟件是否安全，它不會對您的計算機造成任何損害，也不會竊取您的私人數據，安裝病毒或任何其他類似的東西——那麽這是安全的。 ASF is free of malware, data stealing, cryptocurrency miners and any (and all) other doubtful behaviour that can be considered malicious or unwanted by the user. In addition to that we have a dedicated **[remote communication](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Remote-communication)** section which covers our privacy policy and ASF behaviour that goes beyond what you configured the program to do yourself.

Our code is open-source, and distributed binaries are always compiled from **[publicly available sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)** by **[automated and trusted continuous integration systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation)**, and not even developers themselves. Each build is reproducible by following our build script and will result in exactly the same, **[deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system)** IL (binary) code. If you for whatever reason don't trust our builds, you can always compile and use ASF from source, including all libraries that ASF is using (such as SteamKit2), which are open-source too.

In the end however, it's always a matter of trust to the developer(s) of your application, so you should decide yourself if you consider ASF safe or not, potentially supporting your decision with technical arguments specified above. 不要對我奉若神明，言聽計從——自己檢查一下，因為這是確保安全的唯一方法。

---

### 我會因此被封禁嗎？

為了回答這個問題，我們應該仔細閲讀** [ Steam ToS ](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement) **。 Steam doesn't prohibit using of multiple accounts, in fact, **[it allows it](https://help.steampowered.com/faqs/view/7EFD-3CAE-64D3-1C31#share)** implying that you can use same mobile authenticator on more than one account. What it however doesn't allow is sharing accounts with other people, but we're not doing that here.

The only real point that considers ASF is the following:
> You may not use Cheats, automation software (bots), mods, hacks, or any other unauthorized third-party software, to modify or automate any Subscription Marketplace process.

The question is what in fact is Subscription Marketplace process. As we can read:

> An example of a Subscription Marketplace is the Steam Community Market

We're not modifying or automating subscription marketplace process, if by subscription marketplace we understand steam community market or steam store. 然而...

> Valve may cancel your Account or any particular Subscription(s) at any time in the event that (a) Valve ceases providing such Subscriptions to similarly situated Subscribers generally, or (b) you breach any terms of this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use).

Therefore, as with every Steam software, ASF is not authorized by Valve and I cannot guarantee that you won't be suspended if Valve suddenly decides that they're banning accounts using ASF now. This is exceptionally unlikely considering the fact that ASF is being used on more than a million of Steam accounts, but still a possibility, regardless of actual probability.

Especially because:
> In regard to all Subscriptions, Content and Services that are not authored by Valve, Valve does not screen such third-party content available on Steam or through other sources. Valve assumes no responsibility or liability for such third party content. Some third-party application software is capable of being used by businesses for business purposes - however, you may only acquire such software via Steam for private personal use.

However, Valve clearly acknowledges "Steam idlers" existing, as stated **[here](https://help.steampowered.com/faqs/view/22C0-03D0-AE4B-04E8)**, so if you asked me, I'm pretty sure that if they weren't fine with them, they'd already do something instead of pointing out that they could cause problems VAC-wise. The key word here is **Steam** idlers, for example ASF, and not **game** idlers.

Please note that above is only our interpretation of **[Steam ToS](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement)** and various points - ASF is licensed under Apache 2.0 License, which clearly states:

You're using this software at your own risk. It's very unlikely that you can get banned for that, but if you do, you can blame only yourself for that.

### 曾經有人因爲使用 ASF 被 Steam 封禁嗎？

**是的**，目前為止我們至少發生過一些導致某種Steam封鎖的事故。 Whether ASF itself was the root cause or not is entirely different story that we'll probably never get to know.

First case involved a guy with over 1000+ bots getting trade banned (together with all bots), most likely due to excessive usage of `loot ASF` executed on all bots at once, or other suspicious one-side amount of trades in a very short time.

> Hello XXX, Thank you for contacting Steam Support. It looks like this account was used to manage a network of bot accounts. Botting is a violation of the Steam Subscriber Agreement.

Please, use some common sense and don't assume that you can do such crazy things only because ASF allows you to do that. Doing `loot ASF` on over 1k of bots can be easily considered a **[DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDoS)** attack, and personally I'm not shocked that somebody got banned for such a thing. Keep minimum of fair use in regards to Steam service, and **most likely** you'll be fine.

Second case involved a guy with 170+ bots getting banned during Steam's 2017 Winter Sale.

> Your account was blocked for violation of the agreement of the subscriber Steam. Judging by the exchanges and other factors, this account was used to illegally collect collectible cards on Steam, as well as related and not only commercial activities. The account has been permanently blocked and Steam Support can not provide additional support on this issue.

This case is once again very hard to analyze, because of vague response from Steam support that barely offers any details. Based on my personal thoughts, this user probably exchanged Steam cards for some kind of money (level up bot?) or in some other way tried to cash out on Steam. In case you were unaware, this is also illegal according to **[Steam ToS](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement)**.

Third case involved user with 120+ bots being banned for breach of **[Steam online conduct](https://store.steampowered.com/online_conduct?l=english)**.

> Hello XXX, Thank you for contacting Steam Support. This and other accounts were used for flooding our network infrastructure, which is a violation of Steam online conduct. The account has been permanently blocked and Steam Support can not provide additional support on this issue.

由於用戶提供了額外的細節，這個案例更容易分析。 Apparently the user was using **a very outdated ASF version** that included a bug causing ASF to send excessive number of requests to Steam servers. The bug itself did not exist at first but was activated due to Steam breaking change that was fixed in future version. **ASF is supported only in [latest stable version](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/latest) released on GitHub**. Software is written by humans, and humans tend to make mistakes. If the mistake has a global scope, it's quickly being patched up and released to all users as a bugfix. Valve won't suddenly ban over a million of ASF users due to my mistake, for obvious reasons. However, if you intentionally resign from using up-to-date ASF, then by definition you're in a very small minority of users that are **exposed to incidents like these** due to **no support**, as there is nobody watching over your outdated version of ASF, nobody fixing it and nobody ensuring that you won't get outright banned by just launching it. **Please use up-to-date software**, not only ASF, but all other applications as well.

The most recent case happened around June of 2021, according to the user:

> Using your program, I have been making booster packages with 28 accounts for 3 years and with 128 accounts for the last 6 months. I was online with maximum 15 accounts simultaneously to make booster packs and send them to the main account. Last month, I increased the number of online accounts simultaneously to 20, and 1 week after that, all of my accounts were banned. This email is not to blame you, on the contrary, I was always aware of the consequences. I wanted you to know what types of behavior result in a permanent ban.

It's hard to say whether increase in concurrent accounts online was the direct reason for the ban, I wouldn't count on that, instead I believe that the number of accounts alone was the main culprit, increased concurrency of online accounts probably just drew attention to the user in question, as he clearly had far more bots than our recommendation.

---

All of the incidents above have one thing in common - ASF is just a tool and it's **your** decision how you're going to make use of it. You do not get banned for using ASF directly, but for **how** you're using it. It can be a helper tool farming just one single account, or a massive farming network made from thousands of bots. In any case, I'm not offering legal advice, and you should decide yourself about your ASF usage in the first place. I'm not hiding any information that could help you, e.g. the fact that ASF got some people banned, as I have no reason to - it's your choice what you want to do with that information. If you ask me - use some common sense, avoid owning more bots than our recommendation, do not send hundreds of trades at the same time, always use up-to-date ASF version and you _should_ be fine. Every single incident of this nature for **some reason** always happened to people that have disregarded our recommendation and decided that they know better than us how many bots they can run. Whether it's just a coincidence or some actual factor, that's up to you to decide. I'm not offering any legal advice, only giving you my thoughts that you can find useful, or disregard them entirely and operate only on facts linked above.

### What privacy information ASF discloses?

You can find detailed explanation in **[remote communication](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Remote-communication)** section. 如果您關心自己的隱私，請查看它，例如： 如果您想知道為什麼使用ASF的帳戶會加入我們的Steam群組。 ASF doesn't collect any sensitive information, and doesn't share it with any third-parties.

---

## 雜項

---

### 我使用不受支援的操作系統，如 32 位 Windows，我還可以使用最新版本的 ASF 嗎？

是的，該版本並非官方構建，且不提供任何支援。 Check out **[compatibility](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Compatibility)** section for generic variant. ASF doesn't have any strong dependency upon the OS, and it can work anywhere where you can get a working .NET runtime, which includes 32-bit Windows, even if there is no `win-x86` OS-specific package from us.

---

### ASF 太讚了！ 我能做些什麽？

是的，我們很高興聽到您正在享受我們的項目！ You can find various donation possibilities under every **[release](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/latest)** and also **[on the main page](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm)**. It's nice to note that in addition to generic money donations we also accept Steam items, so nothing is stopping you from donating skins, keys or a small part of the cards that you've farmed with ASF if you'd like to. Thank you in advance for your generosity!

---

### 我正在使用 Steam 家庭監護 PIN 來保護我的帳戶，我是否需要在某處輸入代碼？

是的，您必須在機械人配置中設置` SteamParentalCode ` 屬性。 This is mainly because ASF does access many protected parts of your Steam account and it's impossible for ASF to operate without it.

---

### I don't want ASF to farm any games by default, yet I want to use extra ASF features. 這可行嗎？

Yes, if you just want to start ASF with paused cards farming module, you can set `Paused` bot config property to `true` in order to achieve that. This will allow you to `resume` it during runtime.

If you want to completely disable cards farming module and ensure that it'll never run without you explicitly telling it otherwise, then we recommend to set `FarmPriorityQueueOnly` to `true`, which instead of just pausing it, will disable the farming completely until you add the games to idle priority queue yourself.

With cards farming module paused/disabled, you can make use of extra ASF features, such as `GamesPlayedWhileIdle`.

---

### ASF 可以最小化到托盤嗎？

ASF is a console app, there is no window to be minimized, because window is created for you by your OS. You can however use any third-party tool capable of doing so, such as **[RBTray](https://github.com/benbuck/rbtray)** for Windows, or **[screen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen)** for Linux/macOS. Those are only examples, there are many other apps with similar functionality.

---

### 使用 ASF 是否能維持我獲得擴充包的資格？

**是的**。 ASF is using the same method to log in to Steam network as the official client, therefore it also preserves ability to receive booster packs for accounts that are being used in ASF. Moreover, preserving that ability doesn't even require logging in into Steam community, so you can safely use `OnlineStatus` in `Offline` setting if you'd like to.

---

### Is there any way to communicate with ASF?

Yes, through several different ways. 查閲 **[命令](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**以了解更多。

---

### 我想為 ASF 翻譯做一些微小的貢獻，我應該怎麽做？

感謝您的熱情！ 您可以在我們的**[當地語系化](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Localization)**章節了解詳情。

---

### I have only one (main) account added to ASF, can I still issue commands through steam chat?

**是的**，這在** [命令](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands#notes) **部分進行了解釋。 You can do so through Steam group chat, although using **[ASF-ui](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/IPC#asf-ui)** could be easier for you.

---

### ASF 已經在運行了，但我沒有收到任何掉落的卡片！

Cards farming rate differs from game to game, as you can read in **[performance](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Performance)**. It takes a while, usually **several hours per game**, and you shouldn't expect cards to drop in a few minutes since launching a program. If you can see that ASF actively checks cards status, and switches the game after current one is fully farmed, then everything works fine. It's possible that you've enabled an option such as `DismissInventoryNotifications` of `BotBehaviour` which automatically dismisses inventory notifications. Check out **[configuration](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)** for details.

---

### 如何完全終止我帳戶的 ASF 進程？

Simply shutdown the ASF process, for example by clicking [X] on Windows. If instead you want to stop a particular bot of your choice but keep other ones running, then take a look at `Enabled` **[bot config property](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#bot-config)**, or `stop` **[command](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**. If you instead want to stop automatic farming process, yet keep ASF running for your account, then that's what `Paused` **[bot config property](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#bot-config)** and `pause` **[command](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)** is for.

---

### 我能用 ASF 同時運行多少個機械人？

ASF as a program doesn't have any hard upper limit of bot instances, so you can run as much as you have memory on your machine, however, you're still being limited by the Steam network and other Steam services. Currently you can run up to 100-200 bots with a single IP and a single ASF instance. It's possible to run more bots with more IPs and more ASF instances, by working around IP limitations. Keep in mind that if you're using that big amount of bots, you should control their number yourself, such as making sure that all of them in fact are logging in and working at the same time. ASF was not tweaked for that huge number of bots, and the general rule applies that **the more bots you have, the more issues you'll encounter**. Also notice that the limit above in general depends on many internal factors, it's approximation rather than a strict limit - you will most likely be able to run more/less bots than specified above.

ASF team suggests running (and **owning**) up to **10 bots in total**, anything above is not supported and done at your own risk, against our suggestion made here. This recommendation is based on internal Valve guidelines, as well as our own suggestions. Whether you're going to comply with this rule or not is your choice, ASF as a tool will not go against your own will, even if it'll result in your Steam accounts being suspended for doing so. Therefore, ASF will display you a warning if you'll go above what we recommend, but still allow you to run anything you want at your own risk and lack of our support.

---

### 我可以運行更多的 ASF 實例嗎？

You can run as many ASF instances on one machine as you like, assuming every instance has its own directory and its own configs, and account used in one instance is not used in another one. 然而，問問自己為什麼要這麼做。 ASF is optimized to handle more than a hundred of accounts at the same time, and launching that hundred of bots in their own ASF instances degrades performance, takes more OS resources (such as CPU and memory), and causes a potential synchronization issues between standalone ASF instances, as ASF is forced to share its limiters with other instances.

Therefore, my **strong suggestion** is, always run maximum of one ASF instance per one IP/interface. If you have more IPs/interfaces, by all means you can run more ASF instances, with every instance using its own IP/interface or unique `WebProxy` setting. If you don't, launching more ASF instances is totally pointless, as you won't gain anything from launching more than 1 instance per a single IP/interface. Steam will not magically allow you to run more bots just because you've launched them in another ASF instance, and ASF doesn't limit you to begin with.

Of course, there are still valid use cases for multiple ASF instances on the same network interface, such as hosting ASF service for your friends with each friend having its own unique ASF instance in order to guarantee isolation between bots and even the ASF processes themselves, however, you're not circumventing any Steam limitations this way, that's entirely different purpose.

### Are you affiliated with any cards farming/idling service?

**不行**。 ASF is not affiliated with any service and all such claims are false. Your Steam account is your property and you can use your account in whatever way you wish, but Valve clearly stated in **[official ToS](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement)** that:

> You are responsible for the confidentiality of your login and password and for the security of your computer system. Valve is not responsible for the use of your password and Account or for all of the communication and activity on Steam that results from use of your login name and password by you, or by any person to whom you may have intentionally or by negligence disclosed your login and/or password in violation of this confidentiality provision.

ASF is licensed on liberal Apache 2.0 License, which allows other developers to further integrate ASF with their own projects and services legally. However, such third-party projects utilizing ASF are not guaranteed to be secure, reviewed, appropriate or legal according to **[Steam ToS](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement)**. If you want to know our opinion, **we strongly encourage you to NOT share ANY of your account details with third-party services**. If such service turns out to be a **typical scam**, you'll be left alone with the problem, most likely without your Steam account and ASF won't take any responsibility for third-party services claiming to be safe and secure, because ASF team did not authorize neither reviewed any of those. In other words, **you're using them at your own risk, against our suggestion made above**.

In addition to that, official **[Steam ToS](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement)** clearly states that:

> You may not reveal, share or otherwise allow others to use your password or Account except as otherwise specifically authorized by Valve.

It's your account and your choice. Just don't say that nobody warned you. ASF as a program meets all rules mentioned above, as you're not sharing your account details with anyone, and you're using the program for your own personal use, but any other "cards farming service" does require from you your account credentials, so it also violates the rule above (actually several of them). Like with **[Steam ToS](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement)** evaluation, we're not offering any legal advice, and you should decide yourself if you want to use those services, or not - according to us **it directly violates [Steam ToS](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement)** and may result in suspension if Valve finds out. Like pointed out above, **we strongly recommend to NOT use any of such services**.

## 問題

---

### One of my games is being farmed for more than 10 hours now, but I still didn't get any cards from it!

The reason for that could be related to known issue of Steam, which happens when you have two licenses for the same game, one of which has card drops limited. This usually happens when you activate game for free during a mass giveaway on Steam, and then activate a key for the same game (but without limitations), e.g. from a paid bundle. If such situation happens, Steam reports on badge page that game still has cards to drop, but no matter how much you play the game - cards will never drop due to free license on your account. Since it's not an ASF issue, but a Steam one, we can't somehow circumvent it on ASF's side, and you need to solve it yourself.

There are two ways to solve the issue. Firstly, you can blacklist this game in ASF, either with `fbadd` **[command](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)** or with `Blacklist` **[configuration property](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)**. This will prevent ASF from trying to farm cards from this game, but will not solve the underlying issue which prevents you from obtaining card drops from the affected game. Secondly, you can use Steam support self-service tool to remove free license from your account, leaving only full license that includes the card drops. In order to do so, firstly visit your **[licenses and product key activations](https://store.steampowered.com/account/licenses)** page and locate both free and paid license for the affected game. Usually it's fairly easy - both have similar name, but free one has "limited free promotional package" or other "promo" in the license name, plus "complimentary" in "acquisition method" field. Sometimes it might be more tricky, for example if free package was in some bundle and has a different name. If you have found two licenses like that - then it's indeed the issue described here, and you can safely remove free license without losing the game.

In order to remove the free license from your account, visit **[Steam support page](https://help.steampowered.com/wizard/HelpWithGame)** and put the affected game name into the search field, the game should be available in "products" section, click on it. Alternatively, you can just use `https://help.steampowered.com/wizard/HelpWithGame?appid=<appID>` link and replace `<appID>` with appID of the game that causes troubles. Afterwards, click on "I want to permanently remove this game from my account" and then select the faulty free license that you've found above, usually the one with "limited free promotional package" in the name (or similar). After removal of the free license, ASF should be able to drop cards from the affected game without issues, you should restart the farming operation after the removal just to be sure that Steam picks up the right license this time.

---

### ASF doesn't detect game `X` as available for farming, yet I know it includes Steam trading cards!

There are two main reasons here. First and most obvious reason is the fact that you're referring to **Steam store** where given game is announced as card drops enabled game. This is **wrong** assumption, as it simply states that the game **has** card drops included, but not necessarily this function for that game is **enabled** right away. You can read more about this in **[official announcement](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1954971077935370845)**.

In short, card drops icon in Steam store doesn't mean anything, check your **[badge pages](https://steamcommunity.com/my/badges)** for confirmation whether a game has card drops enabled or not - this is also what ASF is doing. If your game doesn't appear on the list as a game with cards possible to drop, then this game is **not** possible to farm, regardless of reason.

Second issue is less obvious, and it's the situation when you can see that your game indeed is available with card drops on your badge page, yet it's not being farmed by ASF right away. Unless you're hitting some other bug, such as ASF being unable to check badge pages (described below), it's simply a cache effect and on ASF side Steam is still reporting outdated badges page. This issue should solve itself sooner or later, when cache gets invalidated. There is also no way to fix this on our side.

Of course, all of that assumes that you're running ASF with default untouched settings, since you could also add this game to farming blacklist, use `FarmPriorityQueueOnly`, `SkipRefundableGames` and so on.

---

### Why playtime of games farmed through ASF doesn't increase?

It does, but **not in real-time**. Steam records your playtime in fixed intervals and schedules update for it, but you're not guaranteed to have it updated immediately the moment you quit the session, let alone during such. Just because the playtime isn't updated in real-time doesn't mean that it's not recorded, it's usually updated every 30 minutes or so.

---

### What is the difference between a warning and an error in the log?

ASF writes to its log a bunch of information on various logging levels. Our objective is to explain **precisely** what ASF is doing, including what Steam issues it has to deal with, or other problems to overcome. Most of the time not everything is relevant, this is why we have two major levels being used in ASF in terms of problems - a warning level, and error level.

General ASF rule is that warnings are **not** errors, therefore they should **not** be reported. A warning is an indicator to you that something potentially unwanted happen. Whether it was Steam not reacting, API throwing errors or your network connection being down - it's a warning, and it means we expected it to happen, so don't bother ASF development with it. Of course you're free to ask about them or get help by using our support, but you shouldn't assume that those are ASF errors worth reporting (unless we confirm otherwise).

Errors on the other hand indicate a situation that should not happen, therefore they're worth reporting as long as you made sure that it's not you who is causing them. If it's a common situation that we expect to happen, then it'll be converted to a warning instead. Otherwise, it's possibly a bug that should be corrected, not silently ignored, assuming it's not a result of your own technical issue. For example, putting invalid content in `ASF.json` file will throw an error, as ASF won't be able to parse it, but it was you who put it there, so you should not report that error to us (unless you confirmed that ASF is wrong and your structure is in fact absolutely correct).

In one TL;DR sentence - report errors, don't report warnings. You can still ask about warnings and receive help in our support sections.

---

### ASF doesn't start, the program window closes immediately!

In normal conditions, any ASF crash or exit will generate a `log.txt` in the program's directory for you to view, which can be used for finding the cause of that. In addition to that, a few last log files are also archived in `logs` directory, since the main `log.txt` file is overwritten with each ASF run.

However, if even .NET runtime isn't able to boot on your machine, then `log.txt` will not be generated. If that happens to you then you most likely forgot to install .NET prerequisites, as stated in **[setting up](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Setting-up#os-specific-setup)** guide. Other common problems include trying to launch wrong ASF variant for your OS, or in other way missing native .NET runtime dependencies. If the console window closes too soon for you to read the message, then open independent console and launch ASF binary from there. For example on Windows, open ASF directory, hold `Shift`, right click inside the folder and choose "*open command window here*" (or *powershell*), then type into the console `.\ArchiSteamFarm.exe` and confirm with enter. This way you'll get precise message why ASF is not starting properly.

---

### ASF is kicking my Steam Client session while I'm playing! / *This account is logged on another PC*

This shows up as a message in Steam overlay that the account is being used somewhere else while you're playing. This issue can have two different reasons.

One reason is caused by broken packages (games) that specifically don't hold a playing lock properly, yet expect that lock to be possesed by the client. An example of such package would be Skyrim SE. Your Steam client launches the game properly, but that game doesn't register itself as being used. Because of that, ASF sees that it's free to resume the process, which it does, and that kicks you out of Steam network, as Steam suddenly detects that the account is being used in another place.

Second reason could come up if you're playing on your PC while ASF is waiting (especially on another machine) and you lose your network connection. In this case, Steam network marks you as offline and releases playing lock (like above), which triggers ASF (e.g. on another machine) into resuming farming. When your PC comes back online, Steam can't acquire playing lock anymore (that is now held by ASF, also similar to above) and shows the same message.

Both causes on the ASF side are actually very hard to workaround, as ASF simply resumes farming once Steam network informs it that account is free to be used again. This is what is happening normally when you close the game, but with broken packages this can happen immediately, even if your game is still running. ASF has no way to know whether you got disconnected, stopped playing a game or that you're still playing a game that doesn't hold playing lock appropriately.

The only proper solution to this problem is manually pausing your bot with `pause` before you start playing, and resuming it with `resume` once you're done. Alternatively you can just ignore the problem and act the same as if you played with offline Steam client.

---

### `Disconnected from Steam!` - I can't establish connection with Steam servers.

ASF can only **try** to establish connection with Steam servers, and it can fail due to many reasons, including lack of internet connection, Steam being down, your firewall blocking connection, third-party tools, incorrectly configured routes or temporary failures. You can enable `Debug` mode to check out more verbose log stating exact failure reasons, although usually it's simply caused by your own actions, such as using "CS:GO MM Server Picker" that blacklists a lot of Steam IPs, making it very hard for you to actually reach Steam network.

ASF will do its best to establish connection, which includes not only asking about updated list of servers but also trying another IP when last one fails, so if it's truly a temporary problem with some specific server or route, ASF will connect sooner or later. However, if you're behind firewall or in some other way unable to reach Steam servers, then obviously you need to fix it yourself, with potential help of `Debug` mode.

It's also possible that your machine is not able to establish connection with Steam servers using default protocol in ASF. You can alter protocols that ASF is permitted to use by modifying `SteamProtocols` global configuration property. For example, if you have problems reaching Steam with `UDP` protocol (e.g. due to firewalls), perhaps you'll have more luck with `TCP` or `WebSocket`.

In a very unlikely situation of having incorrect servers being cached, for example because of moving ASF `config` folder from one machine to another machine located in entirely different country, deleting `ASF.db` in order to refresh Steam servers on the next launch may help. Very often it's not needed and doesn't have to be done, as that list is automatically refreshed on first launch, as well as when the connection is established - we're just mentioning it as a way to purge anything related to list of Steam servers cached by ASF.

### `Could not get badges information, will try again later!`

Usually it means that you're using Steam parental PIN to access your account, yet you forgot to put it in ASF config. You must put valid PIN in `SteamParentalCode` bot config property, otherwise ASF will not be able to access most of web content, therefore will not be able to work properly. Head over to **[configuration](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)** in order to learn more about `SteamParentalCode`.

Other reasons include temporary Steam problem, network issue or likewise. If issue won't solve itself after several hours and you're sure that you configured ASF appropriately, feel free to let us know about that.

### ASF is failing with `Request failed after 5 tries` errors!

Usually it means that you're using Steam parental PIN to access your account, yet you forgot to put it in ASF config. You must put valid PIN in `SteamParentalCode` bot config property, otherwise ASF will not be able to access most of web content, therefore will not be able to work properly. Head over to **[configuration](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)** in order to learn more about `SteamParentalCode`.

If parental PIN is not the reason, then this is a most common error, and you should get used to that, it simply means that ASF sent a request to Steam Network, and didn't get a valid response, 5 times in a row. Usually it means that Steam is either down or is having some difficulties or maintenance - ASF is aware of such issues and you should not worry about them, unless they're happening constantly for longer than several hours, and other users do not have such problems.

How to check if Steam is being down? **[Steam Status](https://steamstat.us)** is an excellent source of checking if Steam **should be** up, if you notice errors, especially related to Community or Web API, then Steam is having difficulties. You may want to leave ASF alone and let it do its job after a short while of downtime, or quit it and wait yourself.

That's however not always the case, as in some situations Steam issues may not be detected by Steam Status, for example such case happened when Valve broke HTTPS support for Steam Community 7th June 2016 - accessing **[SteamCommunity](https://steamcommunity.com)** through HTTPS was throwing an error. Therefore, do not blindly trust Steam Status either, it's best to check yourself if everything works as supposed to.

In addition to that, Steam includes various rate-limiting measures which will temporarily ban your IP if you make excessive number of requests at once. ASF is aware of that and offers you several different limiters in the config, which you should make use of. Default settings were tweaked based on **sane** amount of bots, if you're using so huge amount that even Steam is telling you to go away, then you either tweak them until it no longer tells you to, or you do as you're told. I assume second way is not an option to you, so go read on that topic and pay special attention to `WebLimiterDelay` which is a general limiter that applies to all web requests.

There is no "golden rule" that works for everybody, because blocks are heavily influenced by third-party factors, that's why you have to experiment yourself and find a value that works for you. You can also ignore what I say and use something like `10000` which is guaranteed to work correctly, but then don't complain how your ASF reacts to everything in 10 seconds and how badge parsing takes 5 minutes. In addition to that, it's entirely possible that no limiter will do anything because you have so huge amount of bots that you're hitting **[hard limit](#how-many-bots-can-i-run-with-asf)** that was mentioned above. Yes, it's entirely possible that you'll be able to log in without issues into Steam network (client), but Steam web (website) will refuse to listen to you if you have 100 sessions established at once. ASF requires both Steam network and Steam web to be cooperative, it takes just one down to make you issues you won't recover from.

If nothing helps and you have no clue what is broken, you can always enable `Debug` mode and see yourself in ASF log why exactly requests are failing. 範例：

```text
InternalRequest() HEAD https://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/settings
InternalRequest() Forbidden <- HEAD https://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/settings
```

See that `Forbidden` code? This means that you got temporarily banned for excessive amount of requests, because you didn't tweak `WebLimiterDelay` properly yet (assuming you get the same error code for all other requests as well). There could be other reasons listed there, such as `InternalServerError`, `ServiceUnavailable` and timeouts that indicate Steam maintenance/issues. You can always try to visit the link mentioned by ASF yourself and check if it works - if it doesn't, then you know why ASF can't access that either. If it does, and the same error doesn't go away after a day or two, it may be worth investigating and reporting.

Before doing that you should **make sure that the error is worth reporting in the first place**. If it's mentioned in this FAQ, such as trading-related issue, then that's out. If it's temporary issue that happened once or twice, especially when your network was unstable or Steam was down - that's out. However, if you were able to reproduce your issue several times in a row, across 2 days, restarted ASF as well as your machine in the process and made sure that there is no FAQ entry here to help resolve it, then this may be worth asking about.

### ASF seems to freeze and doesn't print anything on the console until I press a key!

You're most likely using Windows and your console has QuickEdit mode enabled. Refer to **[this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30418886/how-and-why-does-quickedit-mode-in-command-prompt-freeze-applications)** question on StackOverflow for technical explanation. You should disable QuickEdit mode by right clicking your ASF console window, opening properties, and unchecking appropriate checkbox.

---

### ASF can't accept or send trades!

Obvious thing first - new accounts start as limited. Until you unlock account by loading its wallet or spending $5 in the store, ASF can't accept neither send trades using this account. In this case, ASF will state that inventory seems empty, because every card that is in it is non-tradable.

Next, if you do not use **[ASF 2FA](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Two-factor-authentication)**, it's possible that ASF in fact accepted/sent trade, but you need to confirm it via your e-mail. Likewise, if you use classic 2FA, you need to confirm the trade via your authenticator. Confirmations are **mandatory** now, so if you don't want to accept them by yourself, consider importing your authenticator into ASF 2FA.

Also notice that you can trade only with your friends, and people with known trade link. If you're trying to initiate *Bot -> Master* trade, such as `loot`, then you need to either have your bot on your friendlist, or your `SteamTradeToken` declared in Bot's config. Make sure that the token is valid - otherwise, you won't be able to send a trade.

Lastly, remember that new devices have 7-days trade lock, so if you've just added your account to ASF, wait at least 7 days - everything should work after that period. That limitation includes **both** accepting **and** sending trades. It does not always trigger, and there are people who can send and accept trades instantly. Majority of the people are affected though, and the lock **will** happen, even if you can send and accept trades through your steam client on the same machine. Just wait patiently, there's nothing you can do to make it faster. Likewise, you may get similar lock for removing/changing various Steam security-related settings, such as 2FA, SteamGuard, password, e-mail and likewise. In general, check if you can send a trade from that account yourself, if yes, very likely it's classic 7-days lock from new device.

And finally, keep in mind that one account can have only 5 pending trades to another one, so ASF will fail to send trades if you have 5 (or more) pending ones from that one bot to accept already. This is rarely a problem, but it's also worth mentioning, especially if you set ASF to auto-send trades, yet you're not using ASF 2FA and forgot to actually confirm them.

If nothing helped, you can always enable `Debug` mode and check yourself why requests are failing. Please note that Steam talks nonsense most of the time, and provided reason may not make any logical sense, or can be even entirely incorrect - if you decide to interpret that reason, make sure you have decent knowledge about Steam and its quirks. It's also quite common to see that issue with no logical reason, and the only suggested solution in this case is to re-add account to ASF (and wait 7 days again). Sometimes this issue also fixes itself *magically*, the same way it breaks. However, usually it's just either 7-days trade lock, temporary steam problem, or both. It's best to give it a few days before manually checking what is wrong, unless you have some urge to debug the real cause (and usually you'll be forced to wait anyway, because error message won't make any sense, neither help you in the slightest).

In any case, ASF can only **try** to send a proper request to Steam in order to accept/send trade. Whether Steam accepts that request, or not, is out of the scope of ASF, and ASF will not magically make it work. There's no bug related to that feature, and there is also nothing to improve, because logic is happening outside of ASF. Therefore, do not ask for fixing stuff that is not broken, and also do not ask why ASF can't accept or send trades - **I don't know, and ASF doesn't know either**. Either deal with it, or fix yourself, if you know better.

### Why do I have to put 2FA/SteamGuard code on each login? / *Removed expired login key*

ASF uses login keys (if you kept `UseLoginKeys` enabled) for keeping credentials valid, the same mechanism that Steam uses - 2FA/SteamGuard token is required only once. However, due to Steam network issues and quirks, it's entirely possible that login key is not saved in the network, we've already seen such issues not only with ASF, but with regular steam client as well (a need to input login + password on each run, regardless of "remember me" option).

You could remove `BotName.db` and `BotName.bin` (if available) of affected account and try to link ASF to your account once again, but that likely won't do anything. Some users have reported that **[deauthorizing all devices](https://store.steampowered.com/twofactor/manage)** on Steam side should help, changing password will do the same. However, those are only workarounds that are not even guaranteed to work, the real ASF-based solution is to import your authenticator as **[ASF 2FA](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Two-factor-authentication)** - this way ASF can generate tokens automatically when they're needed, and you don't have to input them manually. Usually the issue magically solves itself after some time, so you can simply wait for that to happen. Of course you can also ask Valve for solution, because I can't force Steam network to accept our login keys.

As a side note, you can also turn off login keys with `UseLoginKeys` config property set to `false`, but this will not solve the problem, only skip the initial login key failure. ASF is already aware of the issue explained here and will try its best to not use login keys if it can guarantee itself all login credentials, so there is no need to tweak `UseLoginKeys` manually if you can provide all login details together with using ASF 2FA.

### I'm getting error: *Unable to login to Steam: `InvalidPassword` or `RateLimitExceeded`*

This error can mean a lot of things, some of them include:

- Invalid Login/Password combination (obviously)
- Expired login key used by ASF for logging in
- Too many failed login attempts in short period of time (anti-bruteforce)
- Too many login attempts in short period of time (rate-limiting)
- Requirement of captcha to log in (very likely to be caused by two reasons above)
- Any other reason Steam Network may have preventing you from logging in

In case of anti-bruteforce and rate-limiting, problem will disappear after some time, so just wait and don't attempt to log in in the meantime. If you hit that issue frequently, perhaps it's wise to increase `LoginLimiterDelay` config property of ASF. Excessive program restarts and other intentional/non-intentional login requests definitely won't help with that issue, so try to avoid it if possible.

In case of expired login key - ASF will remove old one and ask for new one on next login (which will require from you putting 2FA token if your account is 2FA-protected. If your account is using ASF 2FA, token will be generated and used automatically). This can naturally happen over time, but if you get this issue on each login, it's possible that Steam for some reason decided to ignore our login key save requests, as mentioned in the issue **[above](#why-do-i-have-to-put-2fasteamguard-code-on-each-login--removed-expired-login-key)**. You can of course disable `UseLoginKeys` entirely, but that won't solve the issue, only avoid a need of removing expired login keys each time. The real solution, as per the issue above, is to use ASF 2FA.

And lastly, if you used wrong login + password combination, obviously you need to correct this, or disable bot that is attempting to connect using those credentials. ASF can't guess on its own whether `InvalidPassword` means invalid credentials, or any of the reasons listed above, therefore it'll keep trying until it succeeds.

Keep in mind that ASF has its own built-in system to react accordingly to steam quirks, eventually it will connect and resume its job, therefore it's not required to do anything if the issue is temporary. Restarting ASF in order to magically fix problems will only make things worse (as new ASF won't know previous ASF state of not being able to log in, and try to connect instead of waiting), so avoid doing that unless you know what you're doing.

Finally, as with every Steam request - ASF can only **try** to log in, using your provided credentials. Whether that request will succeed or not is out of the scope and logic of ASF - there is no bug, and nothing can be fixed neither improved in this regard.

### `System.IO.IOException: Input/output error`

If this error happened during ASF input (e.g. you can see `Console.ReadLine()` in the stacktrace) then it's caused by your environment which prohibits ASF from reading standard input of your console. That can occur due to a lot of reasons, but the most common one is you running ASF in the wrong environment (e.g. in `nohup` or `&` background instead of `screen` on Linux). If ASF can't access its standard input, then you'll see this error logged and ASF's inability to use your details during runtime.

If you **expect** this to happen, so you **intend** to run ASF in input-less environment, then you should explicitly tell ASF that it's the case, by setting **[`Headless`](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#headless)** mode appropriately. This will tell ASF to never ask for user input under any circumstance, allowing you to run ASF in input-less environments safely.

### `System.Net.Http.WinHttpException: A security error occurred`

This error happens when ASF can't establish secure connection with given server, almost exclusively because of SSL certificate mistrust.

In almost all cases this error is caused by **wrong date/time on your machine**. Every SSL certificate has issued date and expiry date. If your date is invalid and out of those two bounds then the certificate can't be trusted due to a potential **[MITM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)** attack and ASF refuses to make a connection.

Obvious solution is to set the date on your machine appropriately. It's highly recommended to use automatic date synchronization, such as native synchronization available on Windows, or `ntpd` on Linux.

If you made sure that the date on your machine is appropriate and the error doesn't want to go away, SSL certificates that your system trusts could be out-of-date or invalid. In this case you should ensure that your machine can establish secure connections, for example by checking if you can access `https://github.com` with any browser of your choice, or CLI tool such as `curl`. If you confirmed that this works properly, feel free to post issue on our Steam group.

### `System.Threading.Tasks.TaskCanceledException: A task was canceled`

This warning means that Steam did not answer to ASF request in given time. Usually it's caused by Steam networking hiccups and does not affect ASF in any way. In other cases it's the same as request failing after 5 tries. Reporting this issue makes no sense most of the time, as we can't force Steam to respond to our requests.

---

### `The type initializer for 'System.Security.Cryptography.CngKeyLite' threw an exception`

This problem is almost exclusively caused by disabled/stopped `CNG Key Isolation` Windows service, which provides core cryptography functionality for ASF, without which the program isn't able to run. You can fix this issue by launching `services.msc` and ensuring that `CNG Key Isolation` Windows service doesn't have disabled startup and is currently running.

### ASF is being detected as a malware by my AntiVirus! What's going on?

**Ensure that you downloaded ASF from trusted source**. The only official and trusted source is **[ASF releases](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/latest)** page on GitHub (and this is also the source for ASF auto-updates) - **any other source is untrusted by definition and can contain malware added by other people** - you should not trust any other download location by definition, and ensure that your ASF always comes from us.

If you confirmed that ASF is downloaded from trusted source, then very likely it's simply a false positive. This **happened in the past**, **is happening right now**, and **will happen in the future**. If you're worried about actual safety when using ASF, then I suggest scanning ASF with many different AVs for actual detection ratio, for example through **[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com)** (or any other web service of your choice like this).

If the AV that you're using falsely detects ASF as a malware, then **it's a good idea to send this file sample back to developers of your AV, so they can analyze it and improve their detection engine**, as clearly it's not working as good as you think it does. There is no issue in ASF code, and there is also nothing to fix for us, since we're not distributing malware in the first place, therefore it doesn't make any sense to report those false-positives to us. We highly recommend to send ASF sample for further analysis like stated above, but if you don't want to bother with it, then you can always add ASF to some kind of AV exceptions, disable your AV or simply use another one. Sadly, we're used to AVs being stupid, as every once in a while some AV detects ASF as a virus, which usually lasts very short and is being patched up quickly by the devs, but like we pointed out above - **it happened**, **happens** and **will happen** all the time. ASF doesn't include any malicious code, you can review ASF code and even compile from source yourself. We're not hackers to obfuscate ASF code in order to hide from AV heuristics and false positives, so do not expect from us to fix what is not broken - there is no "virus" for us to fix.
