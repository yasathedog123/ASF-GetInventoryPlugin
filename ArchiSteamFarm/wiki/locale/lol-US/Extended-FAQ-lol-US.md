### HOO HAS CREATD ASF?

ASF WUZ CREATD BY **[ARCHI](https://github.com/JustArchi)** IN OCTOBR 2015. IN CASE U WUZ WONDERIN, IM **[STEAM USR](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006963719)** JUS LIEK U. APART FRUM PLAYIN GAMEZ, I ALSO LUV 2 PUT MAH SKILLS AN DETERMINASHUN 2 USE, WHICH U CAN EXPLORE RITE NAO. THAR IZ NO HOOJ COMPANY INVOLVD HER, NO TEAM OV DEVELOPERS AN NO $1M OV BUDGET 2 COVR ALL OV DAT - JUS ME, FIXIN THINGS DAT R NOT BROKD.

HOWEVR, ASF IZ OPEN-SOURCE PROJECT, AN I CANT EXPRES ENOUGH DAT IM NOT BEHIND EVRYTHIN DAT U CAN C HER. WE HAS FEW **[OTHR](https://github.com/JustArchiNET?q=ASF-)** ASF PROJECTS DAT R BEAN DEVELOPD ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BY OTHR DEVELOPERS. EVEN CORE ASF PROJECT HAS LOT OV **[CONTRIBUTORS](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/graphs/contributors)** DAT HELPD ME 2 MAK ALL OV DIS HAPPEN. ON TOP OV DAT, THAR R SEVERAL THIRD-PARTY SERVICEZ SUPPORTIN ASF DEVELOPMENT, ESPECIALLY **[GITHUB](https://github.com)**, **[JETBRAINS](https://www.jetbrains.com)** AN **[CROWDIN](https://crowdin.com)**. U ALSO CANT FORGET BOUT ALL TEH AWSUM LIBRARIEZ AN TOOLS DAT MADE ASF HAPPEN, SUCH AS **[RIDR](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider)** DAT WE USE AS IDE (WE LUV **[RESHARPR](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper)** ADDISHUNS) AN ESPECIALLY **[STEAMKIT2](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit)** WITHOUT WHICH ASF WUD NOT EXIST IN DA FURST PLACE. ASF ALSO WOULDNT BE WER IT TODAI WITHOUT MAH **[SPONSORS](https://github.com/sponsors/JustArchi)** AN VARIOUS DONATORS, SUPPORTIN ME IN EVRYTHIN DAT IM DOIN HER.

THANK U ALL 4 HELPIN IN ASF DEVELOPMENT! URE AWSUM :heart:.

### Y WUZ ASF CREATD IN DA FURST PLACE?

ASF WUZ CREATD WIF PRIMARY PURPOSE OV BEAN FULLY AUTOMATD STEAM FARMIN TOOL 4 LINUX, WITHOUT NED OV ANY EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIEZ (SUCH AS STEAM CLIENT). IN FACT, DIS STILL REMAINS ITZ PRIMARY PURPOSE AN FOCUS, CUZ MAH CONCEPT OV ASF DIDNT CHANGE SINCE DEN AN IM STILL USIN IT IN EGSAKTLY TEH SAME WAI AS I USD IT BAK IN 2015. OV COURSE, THAR WUZ RLY **A LOT** OV CHANGEZ SINCE DEN, AN IM VRY HAPPEH 2 C HOW FAR ASF HAS PROGRESD, MOSTLY THX 2 ITZ USERS, CUZ ID NEVR CODE EVEN HALF OV TEH FEATUREZ IF IT WUZ 4 MYSELF ONLY.

IZ NICE 2 NOWT DAT ASF WUZ NEVR MADE 2 COMPETE WIF OTHR, SIMILAR PROGRAMS, ESPECIALLY **[IDLE MASTAH](https://www.steamidlemaster.com)**, CUZ ASF WUZ NEVR DESIGND 2 BE DESKTOP/USR APP, AN IT STILL ISNT TODAI. IF U ANALYZE PRIMARY PURPOSE OV ASF DESCRIBD ABOOV, DEN ULL C HOW IDLE MASTAH IZ **TEH EGSAKT OPPOSIET** OV ALL OV DAT. WHILE U CAN MOST DEFINITELY FIND SIMILAR 2 ASF PROGRAMS TODAI, NOTHIN WUZ GUD ENOUGH 4 ME BAK DEN (AN STILL ISNT TODAI), SO I CREATD MAH OWN SOFTWARE, TEH WAI I WANTD IT. OVAR TIEM USERS HAS MIGRATD 2 ASF MAINLY DUE 2 ROBUSTNES, STABILITY AN SECURITY, BUT ALSO ALL TEH FEATUREZ DAT I HAS DEVELOPD ACROS ALL DOSE YEERS. TODAI, ASF IZ BETTR THAN EVR BEFORE.

### K, WER IZ TEH KATCH? WUT DO U GAIN FRUM SHARIN ASF?

THAR IZ NO KATCH, I CREATD ASF **4 MYSELF** AN SHARD IT WIF TEH REST OV TEH COMMUNITY IN HOPE DAT ITLL COME USEFUL. EGSAKTLY TEH SAME TING HAPPEND BAK IN 1991, WHEN LINUS TORVALDZ **[SHARD HIS FURST LINUX KERNEL](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.os.Minix/dlNtH7RRrGA/SwRavCzVE7gJ)** WIF TEH REST OV TEH WURLD. THAR IZ NO HIDDEN MALWARE, DATA MININ, CRYPTO MININ OR ANY OTHR ACTIVITY DAT WUD GENERATE ANY MONETARY BENEFIT 4 ME. ASF PROJECT IZ SUPPORTD ENTIRELY BY NON-OBLIGATORY DONASHUNS SENT BY HAPPEH USERS SUCH AS U. U CAN USE ASF IN EGSAKTLY TEH SAME WAI HOW IM USIN IT, AN IF U LIEK IT, U CAN ALWAYS BUY ME COFFEH, SHOWIN UR GRATITUDE 4 WUT IM DOIN.

IM ALSO USIN ASF AS PERFIK EXAMPLE OV MODERN C# PROJECT DAT ALWAYS STRIKEZ 4 PERFECSHUN AN BEST PRACTICEZ, BE IT WIF TECHNOLOGY, PROJECT MANAGEMENT OR TEH CODE ITSELF. IZ MAH DEFINISHUN OV "THINGS DUN RITE", SO IF BY ANY CHANCE U MANAGE 2 LERN SOMETHIN USEFUL FRUM MAH PROJECT, DEN DAT WILL MAK ME ONLY MOAR HAPPEH.

### RITE AFTR LAUNCHIN ASF I HAS LOST ALL MAH ACCOUNTS/ITEMS/FRENZ/(...)!

STATISTICALLY SPEAKIN, REGARDLES HOW SAD IT IZ, IZ GUARANTED DAT SHORTLY AFTR LAUNCHIN ASF THAR WILL BE AT LEAST WAN GUY HOO WILL DYE IN CAR ACCIDENT. TEH DIFFERENCE IZ DAT NOBODY SANE WILL BLAME ASF 4 CAUSIN IT, BUT 4 SUM REASON THAR R PEEPS HOO WILL ACCUSE ASF OV TEH SAME JUS CUZ IT HAPPEND 2 THEIR STEAM ACCOUNTS INSTEAD. OV COURSE WE CAN UNDERSTAND TEH REASONIN 4 DAT, AFTR ALL ASF OPERATEZ WITHIN STEAM PLATFORM, SO NATURALLY PEEPS WILL ACCUSE ASF OV EVRYTHIN DAT HAPPEND 2 THEIR STEAM-RELATD PROPERTY REGARDLES OV LACK OV ANY EVIDENCE DAT TEH SOFTWARE THEY RAN IZ EVEN REMOTELY CONNECTD WID DAT WHATSOEVR.

ASF, AS STATD IN **[FAQ](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/FAQ-lol-US#iz-safe)** AS WELL AS **[QUESHUN ABOOV](#k-wer-iz-teh-katch-wut-do-u-gain-frum-sharin-asf)**, IZ FREE OV MALWARE, SPYWARE, DATA MININ AN ANY OTHR POTENTIALLY UNWANTD ACTIVITY, **ESPECIALLY** SUBMISHUN OV UR SENSITIV STEAM DETAILS OR TAKIN OVAR UR DIGITAL PROPERTY. IF SOMETHIN LIEK DIS HAS HAPPEND 2 U, WE CAN ONLY SAY DAT WERE SRY 4 UR LOS AN RECOMMEND U 2 CONTACT **[STEAM SUPPORT](https://help.steampowered.com)** WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL ASSIST U IN DA RECOVERY PROCES - CUZ WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE 4 WUT HAPPEND 2 U IN ANY WAI AN R CONSCIENCE IZ CLEAR. IF U BLEEV OTHERWIZE, THAZ UR DECISHUN, IZ POINTLES 2 ELABORATE FURTHR, IF TEH ABOOV RESOURCEZ PROVIDIN OBJECTIV AN VERIFIABLE WAYS 2 CONFIRM R STATEMENT DIDNT CONVINCE U, DEN IZ NOT LIEK ANYTHIN WE RITE HER WILL ANYWAY.

HOWEVR, TEH ABOOV DOESNT MEEN DAT **UR ACSHUNS** DUN WITHOUT COMMON SENSE WIF ASF CANT CONTRIBUTE 2 SECURITY ISSUE. 4 EXAMPLE, U CUD DISREGARD R SECURITY GUIDELINEZ, EXPOSE ASFS **[IPC](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/IPC-lol-US)** INTERFACE 2 TEH WHOLE INTERNET, AN DEN BE SURPRISD DAT SOMEBODY GOT IN AN ROBBD U OUT OV ALL ITEMS. PEEPS DO IT ALL TEH TIEM, THEY FINKZ DAT IF THAR IZ NO DOMAIN OR ANY CONNECSHUN 2 THEIR IP ADDRES DEN NOBODY WILL 4 SURE FIND OUT THEIR ASF INSTANCE. RITE AS U READ IT, THAR R **THOUSANDZ** IF NOT MOAR FULLY-AUTOMATD BOTS CRAWLIN THRU TEH WEB, INCLUDIN RANDOM IP ADDRESEZ, SEARCHIN 4 VULNERABILITIEZ 2 DISCOVR, AN ASF AS QUITE POPULAR PROGRAM IZ ALSO TARGET OV DOSE. WE ALREADY HAD ENOUGH OV PEEPS DAT GOT "HACKD" THRU THEIR OWN STUPIDITY LIEK DAT, SO TRY 2 LERN FRUM THEIR MISTAKEZ AN BE SMARTR INSTEAD OV JOININ THEM.

SAME GOEZ 4 SECURITY OV UR PC. YEZ, HAVIN MALWARE ON UR PC RUINS EVRY SINGLE SECURITY ASPECT OV ASF, AS IT CAN READ SENSITIV DETAILS FRUM ASF CONFIG FILEZ OR PROCES MEMS AN EVEN INFLUENCE TEH PROGRAM 2 DO STUFF DAT IT WOULDNT DO OTHERWIZE. NO, TEH LAST CRACK UVE OBTAIND FRUM DOUBTFUL SOURCE WUZ NOT "FALSE POSITIV" AS SOMEBODY HAS TOLD U, IZ WAN OV TEH MOST EFFECTIV WAYS 2 GAIN CONTROL OVAR SOMEBODYS PC, TEH GUY WILL INFECT HIM AN HELL EVEN FOLLOW TEH INSTRUCSHUNS HOW 2, FASCINATIN.

IZ USIN ASF COMPLETELY SAFE AN FREE OV ALL RISKZ DEN? NO, WED BE BUNCH OV HYPOCRITEZ STATIN SO, AS **EVRY** SOFTWARE HAS ITZ SECURITY-ORIENTD PROBLEMS. CONTRARY 2 WUT LOT OV COMPANIEZ R DOIN, WERE TRYIN 2 BE AS TRANZPARENT AS POSIBLE IN R **[SECURITY ADVISORIEZ](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/security/advisories)** AN AS SOON AS WE FIND OUT EVEN *HYPOTHETICAL* SITUASHUN WER ASF CUD CONTRIBUTE IN ANY WAI 2 POTENTIALLY UNWANTD FRUM SECURITY PERSPECTIV SITUASHUN, WE ANNOUNCE IT IMMEDIATELY. DIS AR TEH WUT HAPPEND WIF **[CVE-2021-32794](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/security/advisories/GHSA-wxx4-66c2-vj2v)** 4 EXAMPLE, EVEN THOUGH ASF DIDNT HAS ANY SECURITY FLAW PER-SE, BUT RATHR BUG DAT CUD LEAD 2 USR ACCIDENTALLY CREATIN WAN.

AS OV TODAI, THAR R NO KNOWN, UNPATCHD SECURITY FLAWS IN ASF, AN AS TEH PROGRAM IZ USD BY MOAR AN MOAR PEEPS OUT OV WHICH BOTH **[WITE HATS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security))** AS WELL AS **[BLACK HATS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat_(computer_security))** ANALYZE ITZ SOURCE CODE, TEH OVERALL TRUST FACTOR ONLY INCREASEZ WIF TIEM, AS TEH NUMBR OV SECURITY FLAWS 2 FIND OUT IZ FINITE, AN ASF AS PROGRAM DAT FOCUSEZ FURST AN FOREMOST ON ITZ SECURITY, DEFINITELY ISNT MAKIN IT EASY 4 FINDIN WAN. REGARDLES OV R BEST INTENSHUNS, WE STILL RECOMMEND 2 STAY KEWL-HEADD AN ALWAYS BE WARY OV POTENTIAL SECURITY THREATS, ONEZ COMIN FRUM ASF USAGE AS WELL.

### HOW DO I VERIFY DAT TEH DOWNLOADD FILEZ R GENUINE?

AS PART OV R RELEASEZ ON GITHUB, WE UTILIZE VRY SIMILAR VERIFICASHUN PROCES AS TEH WAN USD BY **[DEBIAN](https://www.debian.org/CD/verify)**. IN EVRY OFFISHUL RELEASE STARTIN WIF ASF V5.1.3.3, IN ADDISHUN 2 `zip` FILEZ U CAN FIND `SHA512SUMS` AN `SHA512SUMS.sign` FILEZ. DOWNLOAD THEM 4 VERIFICASHUN PURPOSEZ TOGETHR WIF TEH `zip` FILEZ OV UR CHOICE.

FIRSTLY, U SHUD USE `SHA512SUMS` FILE IN ORDR 2 VERIFY DAT `SHA-512` CHECKSUM OV TEH SELECTD `zip` FILEZ MATCHEZ TEH WAN WE CALCULATD OURSELVEZ. ON LINUX, U CAN USE `sha512sum` UTILITY 4 DAT PURPOSE.


```
$ sha512sum -c --ignore-missing SHA512SUMS
ASF-linux-x64.zip: OK
```

ON WINDOWS, WE CAN DO DAT FRUM POWERSHELL, ALTHOUGH U HAS 2 MANUALLY VERIFY WIF `SHA512SUMS`:

```

---------       ----                                                                   ----

```

DIS WAI WE ENSURD DAT WHATEVR WUZ WRITTEN 2 `SHA512SUMS` MATCHEZ TEH RESULTIN FILEZ AN THEY WUZ NOT TAMPERD WIF. HOWEVR, IT DOESNT PROOV YET DAT `SHA512SUMS` FILE U CHECKD AGAINST RLY COMEZ FRUM US. 4 DAT, WELL USE `SHA512SUMS.sign` FILE, WHICH HOLDZ DIGITAL PGP SIGNACHUR PROVIN TEH AUTHENTICITY OV `SHA512SUMS`. WE CAN USE `gpg` UTILITY 4 DAT PURPOSE, BOTH ON **[LINUX](https://gnupg.org/download/index.html)** AN **[WINDOWS](https://gpg4win.org)** (CHANGE `gpg` COMMAND INTO `gpg.exe` ON WINDOWS).

```
$ gpg --verify SHA512SUMS.sign SHA512SUMS
gpg: Signature made Mon 02 Aug 2021 00:34:18 CEST
gpg:                using EDDSA key 224DA6DB47A3935BDCC3BE17A3D181DF2D554CCF
gpg: Can't check signature: No public key
```

AS U CAN C, TEH FILE INDED HOLDZ VALID SIGNACHUR, BUT OV UNKNOWN ORIGIN. ULL NED 2 IMPORT ARCHIBOTS **[PUBLIC KEY](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustArchi-ArchiBot/JustArchi-ArchiBot/main/ArchiBot_public.asc)** DAT WE SIGN TEH `SHA-512` SUMS WIF 4 FULL VALIDASHUN.

```
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustArchi-ArchiBot/JustArchi-ArchiBot/main/ArchiBot_public.asc -o ArchiBot_public.asc
$ gpg --import ArchiBot_public.asc
gpg: /home/archi/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: key A3D181DF2D554CCF: public key "ArchiBot <ArchiBot@JustArchi.net>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1

```

FINALLY, U CAN VERIFY TEH `SHA512SUMS` FILE AGAIN:

```
$ gpg --verify SHA512SUMS.sign SHA512SUMS
gpg: Signature made Mon 02 Aug 2021 00:34:18 CEST
gpg:                using EDDSA key 224DA6DB47A3935BDCC3BE17A3D181DF2D554CCF
gpg: Good signature from "ArchiBot <ArchiBot@JustArchi.net>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 224D A6DB 47A3 935B DCC3  BE17 A3D1 81DF 2D55 4CCF
```

DIS HAS VERIFID DAT TEH `SHA512SUMS.sign` HOLDZ VALID SIGNACHUR OV R `224DA6DB47A3935BDCC3BE17A3D181DF2D554CCF` KEY 4 `SHA512SUMS` FILE DAT UVE VERIFID AGAINST.

U CUD BE WONDERIN WER TEH LAST WARNIN COMEZ FRUM. UVE SUCCESFULLY IMPORTD R KEY, BUT DIDNT DECIDE 2 TRUST IT JUS YET. WHILE DIS AR TEH NOT MANDATORY, WE CAN COVR IT AS WELL. NORMALLY DIS INCLUDEZ VERIFYIN THRU DIFFERENT CHANNEL (E.G. FONE CALL, SMS) DAT TEH KEY IZ VALID, DEN SIGNIN TEH KEY WIF UR OWN 2 TRUST IT. 4 DIS EXAMPLE, U CAN CONSIDR DIS WIKI ENTRY AS SUCH (VRY WEAK) DIFFERENT CHANNEL, SINCE TEH ORIGINAL KEY COMEZ FRUM **[ARCHIBOTS PROFILE](https://github.com/JustArchi-ArchiBot)**. IN ANY CASE WELL ASSUME DAT U HAS ENOUGH OV CONFIDENCE AS IT IZ.

FIRSTLY, **[GENERATE PRIVATE KEY 4 YOURSELF](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto#Generating_an_OpenPGP_Key)**, IF U DOAN HAS WAN JUS YET. WELL USE `--quick-gen-key` AS QUICK EXAMPLE.

```
$ gpg --batch --passphrase '' --quick-gen-key "$(whoami)"

### IZ APRIL TEH 1ST AN TEH ASF LANGUAGE CHANGD INTO SOMETHIN STRANGE, WUT IZ GOIN ON?

CONGRATULASHUNS ON DISCOVERIN R APRIL FOOLS EASTR EGG! IF U DIDNT SET CUSTOM `CurrentCulture` OPSHUN, DEN ASF ON APRIL TEH 1ST WILL AKSHULLY USE **[LOLCAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolcat)** LANGUAGE INSTEAD OV UR SISTEM LANGUAGE. IF BY ANY CHANCE UD LIEK 2 DISABLE DAT BEHAVIOUR, U CAN SIMPLY SET `CurrentCulture` 2 TEH LOCALE DAT UD LIEK 2 USE INSTEAD. IZ ALSO NICE 2 NOWT DAT U CAN ENABLE R EASTR EGG UNCONDISHUNALLY, BY SETTIN UR `CurrentCulture` 2 `qps-Ploc` VALUE.
