# RELEASE CYCLE

ASF USEZ COMMON C# VERSHUNIN WIF 4 NUMBERS, WRITTEN AS `A.B.C.D`. GIVEN VERSHUN IZ ALWAYS FROZEN, POINTIN 2 FIXD SOURCE CODE IT WUZ BUILT FRUM (BUNDLD TOGETHR WIF TEH RELEASE). WE DO NOT INTEND 2 REMOOV ANY PREVIOUSLY-PUBLISHD VERSHUN, AS LONG AS R HOSTIN PROVIDR (GITHUB) REMAINS FINE WIF PRESERVIN THEM 4 INDEFINITE FUCHUR, SO U CAN SAFELY ROLLBACK 2 ANY OV THEM WITHOUT NED OV MAKIN SELF-COPIEZ.

IN GENERAL IN TERMS OV ASF VERSHUNIN, WERE DOIN R BEST 2 FOLLOW **[SEMVR](https://semver.org)** VERSHUNIN OV `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` ON TEH 3 LEAST SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS - `B.C.D`. DOSE 3 NUMBERS R DIRECTLY RELATD 2 ASFS CODE. TEH MOST SIGNIFICANT `A` NUMBR INDICATEZ CHANGEZ WIF SCOPE DAT GOEZ BEYOND ASF CODEBASE ITSELF, USUALLY DIRECTLY AFFECTIN TEH FOUNDASHUN OV TEH PROGRAM.

ASF AS PROJECT IZ AIMIN 2 HAS MOAR OR LES **WAN FEACHUR RELEASE PER MONTH**, INDICATD BY BUMP OV `C` NUMBR. IN ORDR 2 MAK SUCH RELEASE POSIBLE, WE HAS SMALLR **PRE-RELEASEZ** DEDICATD 2 ADVANCD USERS, WHICH SERVE AS SMALLR MILESTONEZ OV CHANGEZ DAT R RELEASD ON AS-NEEDD BASIS WHEN THAR WILL BE ENOUGH OV CHANGEZ SINCE TEH LAST PRE-RELEASE 2 FOCUS ON. EVENTUALLY, WHEN FINAL PRE-RELEASE WILL BE DETERMIND 2 BE STABLE AN MACHUR ENOUGH WIF NO KNOWN CRITICAL REGRESHUNS DAT SHUD BE CORRECTD COMPARD 2 PREVIOUS STABLE RELEASE, ITLL BE PROMOTD 2 TEH NEW STABLE RELEASE, AT TEH SAME TIEM OPENIN NEW MONTHLY CYCLE 4 DA NEXT WAN.

WHILE WERE DOIN R BEST 2 ENSURE DAT EVEN R PRE-RELEASEZ R RELATIVELY STABLE, IT SHUD BE NOTD DAT **PRE-RELEASEZ SHUD BE CAREFULLY EVALUATD WHEN RUNNIN IN ANY PRODUCSHUN ENVIRONMENT**. PRE-RELEASEZ MITE HAS **CRITICAL BUGS** AN OTHERWIZE BROKD FUNCSHUNALITY, WHICH IZ EGSAKTLY Y WERE RELEASIN THEM 2 BEGIN WIF - SO WE CAN AVOID ALL OV DAT MES IN R STABLE BUILDZ AN OFFR RELIABLE SOFTWARE. IF URE UNWILLIN 2 ACCEPT HIGHR RISK DAT COMEZ FRUM USIN POTENTIALLY UNSTABLE SOFTWARE, **PLZ AVOID USIN R PRE-RELEASE BUILDZ** AN STICK WIF R **[LATEST STABLE](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/latest)** BUILD INSTEAD, WHICH IZ MOAR APPROPRIATE 4 MAJORITY OV USERS.

DEPENDIN ON AMOUNT OV CHANGEZ IN DA CYCLE, USUALLY THAR WILL BE SINGLE `C` VERSHUN BUMP (FRUM PREVIOUS STABLE), AN `D` BUMPS 4 EVRY PRE-RELEASE ON AS-NEEDD BASIS. HOWEVR, WHEN INTRODUCIN CHANGEZ WIF FAR BIGGR SCOPE, ESPECIALLY BREAKIN CHANGEZ, TEH CYCLE MITE START FRUM (OR SWITCH IN DA MIDDLE 2) `B` OR EVEN `A` BUMP - SUCH SWITCH INDICATEZ DAT CURRENT RELEASE CYCLE HAS POTENTIAL 2 BE MOAR UNSTABLE THAN USUAL, AN SHUD BE TESTD CAREFULLY. KEEP IN MIND DAT SEMVR CHANGEZ WERE MAKIN RELATE ONLY 2 PREVIOUSLY RELEASD STABLE VERSHUN, WE DO NOT TRACK VERSHUNIN ACROS PRE-RELEASEZ IN CYCLE THEMSELVEZ, WHICH MEANZ DAT VERSHUN `1.0.1.2` MITE HAS NEW FEACHUR DAT `1.0.1.1` DIDNT HAS, AS LONG AS TEH PREVIOUSLY MARKD STABLE RELEASE IZ FRUM `1.0.0.X` PPLZ. LIKEWIZE, THAR CUD BE MAJOR BREAKIN CHANGEZ EVEN ACROS 2 PRE-RELEASEZ FRUM TEH SAME CYCLE, WHICH IZ ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN WERE STILL DECIDIN BOUT TEH FINAL SHAPE OV NEWLY-INTRODUCD FUNCSHUNALITY OR SIMILAR.

PLZ NOWT DAT NEWLY INTRODUCD FEATUREZ AN CHANGEZ CUD BE UNDOCUMENTD (E.G. ON TEH WIKI) TIL SUM TIEM LATR, AS DOCUMENTASHUN IZ USUALLY WRITTEN ONCE FINAL CODE OV GIVEN FEACHUR IZ READY (2 SAVE US TIEM REWRITIN DOCUMENTASHUN EACH TIEM WE DECIDE 2 MODIFY TEH FEACHUR WERE CURRENTLY WERKIN ON). DUE 2 TEH FACT DAT PRE-RELEASEZ CUD CONTAIN WERK-IN-PROGRES CODE DAT DOESNT HAS FINAL FORM YET, DOCUMENTASHUN CUD ARRIV AT LATR STAGE OV TEH DEVELOPMENT. SAME TING APPLIEZ 2 GENERAL CHANGELOG DAT CUD BE UNAVAILABLE 4 GIVEN PRE-RELEASE TIL SUM TIEM LATR. THEREFORE IF U DECIDE 2 USE PRE-RELEASEZ DEN BE PREPARD 4 LOOKIN INSIDE ASF **[COMMITS](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/commits/main)** FRUM TIEM 2 TIEM. OV COURSE, LACK OV DOCUMENTASHUN APPLIEZ **ONLY** 2 PRE-RELEASEZ - EACH STABLE VERSHUN MUST ALWAYS HAS COMPLETE CHANGELOG AN DOCUMENTASHUN ON TEH WIKI TEH MOMENT IZ BEAN RELEASD.

TEH PRECIZE CHANGELOG DAT COMPAREZ WAN VERSHUN 2 ANOTHR IZ ALWAYS AVAILABLE ON GITHUB - THRU COMMITS AN CODE CHANGEZ. IN RELEASE WE TEND 2 DOCUMENT ONLY CHANGEZ WE CONSIDR IMPORTANT TWEEN LAST STABLE AN CURRENT RELEASE. SUCH BREEF CHANGELOG IZ NEVR COMPLETE WAN, SO IF UD LIEK 2 C EVRY CHANGE DAT HAPPEND TWEEN WAN VERSHUN AN ANOTHR (SUCH AS R DEPENDENCIEZ UPGRADEZ) - PLZ USE **[GITHUB COMPARISON](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/compare)** 4 DAT.

ASF PROJECT IZ POWERD BY R **[CONTINUOUS INTEGRASHUN PROCES](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/actions)**. EVRY BUILD IZ SUPPOSD 2 BE REPRODUCIBLE, SO IT SHUD NOT BE PROBLEM 2 GRAB SOURCE (INCLUDD IN DA RELEASE) OV GIVEN VERSHUN AN COMPILE YOURSELF RECEIVIN TEH SAME RESULT AS TEH WAN AVAILABLE THRU R PRECOMPILD BINARIEZ. WE TYPICALLY AVOID COMPILIN RELEASEZ OURSELVEZ, AS LONG AS TEH SISTEMS R OPERATIV, TEH RELEASD BINARIEZ COME DIRECTLY FRUM R CI PROCES.
